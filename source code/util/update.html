        <h3>Artifact list</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>Added an action to download artifacts via radial menu.<br>Seems to download the artifact with option
                (<i>Merged Configured and Default Values</i>)
            </li>
            <li>Added a Trace action to IFlows.<br>Only on single environment, Cloud Integration tenants for now,
                because I don't have access to an Edge Integration Cell to test the differences.
            </li>
            <li>Added a Compare action group to Value Mappings, Message Mappings and IFlows.<br>Extremely rudimentary at
                the moment because it's basically a text comparison.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can compare <i>Runtime vs. Designtime</i>, <i>Runtime vs. Runtime on another stage</i> and
                        <i>Designtime vs. Designtime on another stage</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Value Mappings are at least decently structured.</li>
                    <li>For IFlows and Message Mappings it's really just a textual comparison of the IFlow/Mapping.<br>IFlows are
                        also missing a comparison for scripts/mappings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Shows how many differences there are, if any.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Mouse mappings are fixed now, unlike the last two times I thought they were.<br>Unfortunately this means
                that you will most likely have to change them to the buttons you configured previously.
            </li>
            <li>The previous <i>Copy Link</i> action was replaced by <i>Details</i>, now displays meta info about the
                artifact.<br>The specific information depends on the artifact type, but generally you will see stuff
                like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Names</li>
                    <li>IDs</li>
                    <li>Deployment status</li>
                    <li>Deployment version</li>
                    <li>Link to the artifact (You can still copy the link that way)</li>
                    <li>Endpoints</li>
                    <li>Log level</li>
                    <li>Direct dependencies</li>
                    <li>Used adapters</li>
                </ul>
                You can click to copy any piece of information that has a ðŸ“„ symbol next to it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>API Proxy list</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>I don't remember what was available before, but these are the action groups that are available now:
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy Name<b style="color: #900"> / </b>Copy ID</li>
                    <li>Open<b style="color: #900"> / </b>Open in New Tab<b style="color: #900"> / </b>Show Details</li>
                    <li>Stage Switch (Might not work, depending on the naming between stages)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Maybe API Providers, Products and Applications will be added in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>All artifact lists have been visually updated to be more user-friendly (indentation etc.) and blend
                better into the Integration Suite UI.
            </li>
            <li>Side navigation and header bar can now be coloured the same color as the Tenant Tag.<br>The tag will
                automatically be set to the default color, when the header is coloured.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>Some settings will now immediately take effect after saving.
                <ul>
                    <li>Artifact lists will be updated (Mainly affects colors and reloading the shortcut list).</li>
                    <li>Side navigation and header bar background color will be updated, but not reset to default
                        without reloading.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed list at the bottom will also be updated immediately.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Most features should now be disabled, if the configured tenant-based permissions prohibit them</li>
            <li>Artifacts lists load independently of each other</li>
            <li>Artifact lists are periodically refreshed. Toggling a list root element will refresh the list, but it's
                not really reliable yet.
            </li>
            <li>You should only have to dismiss the "Camel Version Update" notification once more per tenant (when/if
                it's running on Camel 3.14)<br>Sorry for the annoying repetitive notifications over the past weeks.
            </li>
            <li>You can also turn on/off notifications about Integration Suite version updates, if you'd like (Settings
                -> General -> Reminders -> Version Updates)<br>Disabling this will also disable Camel Update
                notifications.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Added</h2>
        <h3>Secure Material list</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>Has only 2 action groups for now
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy Name<b style="color: #900"> / </b>Copy User<b style="color: #900"> / </b>Show Details</li>
                    <li>Delete (Careful! You have to confirm it, but it <b>will</b> delete the credential).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Custom Shortcuts</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>This will contain all your custom shortcuts, which you can edit in the overrides tab of the
                settings.<br><i>I know it's manually editing JSON again, but adding this to the UI settings is going to
                    take some time, probably.<br>There are also some things that just aren't supposed to be edited, but
                    I still wanted to leave open a backdoor to do so.</i></li>
            <li>A guide on how to create and customize shortcuts can be found by clicking on the table button next to
                the save button in the settings.<br>Some useful demo shortcuts should automatically be created if
                you:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>newly install the extension</li>
                    <li>automatically update from the old "official" version</li>
                    <li>reset your settings</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Removed</h2>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px">
            <li>The Unlock buttons from anywhere but the artifact list were remove.</li>
            <li>Documentation options were deleted for now. I couldn't shake the feeling, that it caused serious issues
                with message mappings for some reason.
            </li>
