# Twine

This extension adds some quality of life improvements to SAP Integration Suite.

As you would be able to view the source code via your browser any way, there's no real point in hiding it.
This way you can also ensure, that there is nothing fishy about it, other than that it's an absolute mess.

## Installation

There are no plans to add explicit support for a browser, other than Chrome.
It may work on firefox and should work on any other Chromium based browser.

You need Google Chrome to install this plugin. I tested it with version 100. I assume that older versions will work too.
There are two options to install this plugin:

Add the extension via the Chrome Web Store
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sap-cpi-helper/epoggeaemnkacpinjfgccbjakglngkpb)

## Configuration
- TBD

## Privacy Policy

Twine internally uses some of your data, just to work properly. 
Examples include:
- Your E-Mail address (or S-User, I guess)
- Session data (Cookies, CSRF-Tokens)

This data will never be used other than for it's intended purposes (i.e. functioning)
The Chrome Web Store may collect additional data, which I cannot do anything about, unfortunately.
