# Twine

This extension adds some quality of life improvements to SAP Integration Suite.

As you would be able to view the source code via your browser any way, there's no real point in hiding it.
This way you can also ensure, that there is nothing fishy about it, other than that it's an absolute mess.

## Installation

You need Google Chrome to install this plugin.
Add the extension via the Chrome Web Store
- [Twine ("Stable" Release)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/twine/aachbobnhpbjdieoljpkmllonipnalne)

If you would like to have "early access" to even more unstable features than the released ones.
Be aware that this version may include features that are pretty much untested and a potential danger to your Integration Suite's stability and that your configuration may frequently break.
- [Twine (Fast Track Build)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/twine-fast-track-build/mgblhibgmplacfjmhggjopmnekdeabkn)


There are no plans to add explicit support for a browser, other than Chrome.
It may work on firefox and should work on any other Chromium based browser.

## Configuration
- To edit your configuration, open any integration suite and click on the "Twine Settings" button at the bottom left of the side navigation

## Bugs
- Lots

## Change Log

## Privacy Policy

Twine internally has access to some of your data, just to work properly. 
Examples include:
- Session data (Cookies, CSRF-Tokens, Your E-Mail Address)

This will only ever be used for it's intended purposes (i.e. providing Twine's functionality)
The Chrome Web Store may collect additional data, which I cannot do anything about, unfortunately.
